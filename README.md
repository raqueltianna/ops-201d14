# Ops 201d14 Repo!

## About: 
- This repo is a collection of assignments, readings, and notes that I have completed throughout my time as an Ops 201 student!

## The Why: 
- As I grow as a cybersecurity professional knowing things like networking basics, better collaboration and communication, etc. become much more important. As I professional I have to be able to ensure system reliability, be able to effectively troubleshoot, being able to work with a team and learning how to effectively communicate either verbally or through documentation, and many other skills.

## Fundamental Concepts:
- Windows troubleshooting skills
- Remote Connectivity including RDP and SSH
- Task in Linux using Bash scripting
- Network Ports, and Ethernet
- Network troubleshooting
- Github Operations
- Many More!

### Ops Challeneges:
My favorite Ops Challenege assignment and also the one I would like to improve a bit more on was the Loops challenge. The reason this one was my favorite is because being being new at scripting, I found it a little bit difficult. I would like to improve it more because I feel that I could shorten it and make it more simplified. 
The aspect that I would like to improve with my shell scripting skillset is my efficiency and other debugging practices. I would also like to learn more about automation when it comes to common task that I use.
